Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software.</p>

                        <p>Hi! I'm Chezka! I am a recent graduate from the University of San Francisco with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science with Computational Analytics concentration. I have always loved numbers
                          since I was in elementary school so I decided to initially take up BS Applied Math at the University of the Philippines Los Ba&ntilde;os where I studied for 5 years before moving here in the
                          US. Why did I switch to data science? I was looking at different majors that I wanted to take and I was intrigued about data science so I decided to go for it. I knew that it'll take a lot of
                          coding so I was worried at first because I did not have a good experience with my first coding class. During my first semester at USF, I actually love it since then. I have coded in Python, Java
                          and R. It's amazing knowing what I can do with these skills. My family calls me a hacker though, but yeah that's what I do. I aspire to work in a gaming company since I like playing video games.
                        </p>
                        <p>Aside from numbers, I am also into music. I listen to a lot of Kpop (Korean Pop), Khiphop (Korean Hiphop) and classical music. Some of my favorite Kpop artists are EXO, SHINee, Infinite and Big
                          Bang. I recently just got into khiphop, and I like watching Show Me the Money. Some of the khiphop artists I know are Dok2, Jay Park, Bobby and Zico. I've listened to classical music since I was
                          a kid since I grew up around musicians in the family. I play the piano and clarinet though I don't really practice that much, and I have short fingers. I think I have a video up in my youtube
                          channel. I was a part of a chamber ensemble at USF where I played the piano. My favorite piece is Beethoven's 7th!
                        </p>
                        <p>As I mentioned earlier, I like playing video games. This was something that I've isn't consistent in my life since I first played on a Playstation which was ages ago. I grew up with younger male
                          cousins and they always want me to play with them or watch me play. For the past few years, I've been playing a lot of League of Legends. I remember being told by my cousins to stary playing league
                          when I was still in the Philippines but I never gave in to it. I started to finally play around the end of 2014 which was pre-season 5. I remember playing Traxex in DotA before so Ashe was the first
                          champion that I played, and since then I mained ADC. I am really bad at the game; I can play other roles too but definitely not jungle. As for other games, I like playing open world and RPG games
                          like the Witcher series. For some reason, I play horror games but I always end up not finishing it because I get too scared or frustrated - I still haven't finished The Evil Within. That is pretty
                          much what I usually do during my spare time.
                        </p>
